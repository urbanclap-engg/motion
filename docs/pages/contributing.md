## Bug fixes

Open issues can be found on our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/urbanclap-engg/motion/issues) page with a "Bug" label.

These are a great place to start contributing to the repo!

Once you start work on a bug, post your intent on the issue itself. This will prevent more than one person working on it at once.

If the bug you want to work on doesn't have a related issue, open one, and attach the "Bug" label.

## New features

If you want to add some enhancements over the library, open a [Feature Proposal](https://github.com/urbanclap-engg/motion/issues) issue with "enhancement" label.

This will let us talk through your proposal API and/or implementation before you spend time on it.

## Documentation

Attach the documentation related to the change in respective .md file in the [docs folder](https://github.com/urbanclap-engg/motion/tree/main/documentation/docs).

## Development
The process of proposing a change to React Native can be summarized as follows:

1. Fork the [Motion repository](https://github.com/urbanclap-engg/motion) and create your branch from main.
2. Make the desired changes to React Native sources.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation, which lives in [docs folder](https://github.com/urbanclap-engg/motion/tree/main/docs).
5. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you opened a pull request.
6. Make sure your code lints (for example via `npm run lint --fix`).
7. Push the changes to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to the Motion repository.
9. Review and address comments on your pull request.
10. If changes are requested and addressed, please request review to notify reviewers to take another look.

## You're ready!<br />

If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.
